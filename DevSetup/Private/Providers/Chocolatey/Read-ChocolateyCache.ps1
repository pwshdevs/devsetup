.SYNOPSIS
    Reads cached Chocolatey package information from the DevSetup cache file.

.DESCRIPTION
    This function reads cached Chocolatey package data from the DevSetup cache system.
    It automatically handles cache file creation if the file doesn't exist by calling Write-ChocolateyCache,
    and provides comprehensive error handling for file operations. The function returns the cached data
    as an array of strings for use by other Chocolatey-related functions.

.OUTPUTS
    [System.Array]
    Returns the cached data as an array of strings if successful.
    Returns $null if the cache file cannot be read or parsed.

.EXAMPLE
    Read-ChocolateyCache
    
    Reads the Chocolatey cache data and returns it as an array of strings.

.EXAMPLE
    $chocoCache = Read-ChocolateyCache
    if ($chocoCache) {
        Write-Host "Found $($chocoCache.Count) cached entries"
    } else {
        Write-Host "No cache data available"
    }
    
    Demonstrates reading cache data and checking for successful retrieval.

.EXAMPLE
    $cachedPackages = Read-ChocolateyCache
    $gitPackage = $cachedPackages | Where-Object { $_ -like "*git*" }
    
    Shows reading cache data and filtering for specific package information.

.NOTES
    - Uses Get-ChocolateyCacheFile to determine the cache file location
    - Automatically creates cache file if it doesn't exist using Write-ChocolateyCache
    - Throws an exception if cache file creation fails
    - Uses Get-Content to read the cached data as an array of strings
    - Provides comprehensive error handling for file operations
    - Returns $null on any error to allow calling functions to handle gracefully
    - Used by other Chocolatey functions to avoid repeated system queries for performance
    - Provides debug logging when cache file is not found
