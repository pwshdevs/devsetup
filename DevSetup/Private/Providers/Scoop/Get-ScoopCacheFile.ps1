.SYNOPSIS
    Gets the file path for the Scoop package cache file.

.DESCRIPTION
    This function constructs and returns the full path to the Scoop package cache file within the DevSetup
    cache directory. The cache file is used to store information about installed Scoop packages and their
    versions for performance optimization and offline reference. The function uses Get-DevSetupCachePath
    to ensure the cache directory exists before returning the file path.

.OUTPUTS
    [System.String]
    Returns the full path to the Scoop cache file (scoop.cache) within the DevSetup cache directory.

.EXAMPLE
    Get-ScoopCacheFile
    
    Returns the path to the Scoop cache file, e.g., "C:\Users\Username\.devsetup\.cache\scoop.cache"

.EXAMPLE
    $scoopCacheFile = Get-ScoopCacheFile
    if (Test-Path $scoopCacheFile) {
        $cachedData = Get-Content $scoopCacheFile
    }
    
    Gets the cache file path and checks if it exists before reading cached data.

.EXAMPLE
    $cacheFile = Get-ScoopCacheFile
    Export-Clixml -Path $cacheFile -InputObject $scoopPackages
    
    Uses the cache file path to save Scoop package information.

.NOTES
    - Uses Get-DevSetupCachePath to ensure the cache directory exists
    - Returns a consistent file path (scoop.cache) within the DevSetup cache structure
    - The cache file is used for storing Scoop package metadata and version information
    - Does not create the cache file itself - only returns the path where it should be located
    - Used by other Scoop-related functions for performance optimization and data persistence
