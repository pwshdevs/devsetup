# Install-Scoop

## SYNOPSIS
Installs the Scoop package manager on the system.

## SYNTAX

```
Install-Scoop [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>] [<CommonParameters>]

installation success.
The function performs pre-installation checks to avoid duplicate installations
and uses Get-ScoopVersion to verify successful installation completion.

Install-Scoop

### EXAMPLE 2
```
if (-not (Test-ScoopInstalled)) {

}

Shows conditional installation only when Scoop is not already present.
