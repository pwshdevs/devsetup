# Initialize-DevSetup

## SYNOPSIS
Initializes the DevSetup environment and directory structure.

## SYNTAX

```
Initialize-DevSetup [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
This function sets up the complete DevSetup environment by installing core dependencies and creating
the necessary directory structure.
It performs a comprehensive initialization process including
dependency validation, directory creation, and environment path setup.
The function ensures all
prerequisites are in place before DevSetup can be used for environment management operations.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1
```
Initialize-DevSetup
```

Initializes the complete DevSetup environment with default settings.

### EXAMPLE 2
```
if (Initialize-DevSetup) {
    Write-Host "DevSetup is ready for use"
    # Proceed with environment operations
} else {
    Write-Host "DevSetup initialization failed"
    # Handle initialization failure
}
```

Demonstrates conditional logic based on initialization success.

### EXAMPLE 3
```
$setupReady = Initialize-DevSetup
if ($setupReady) {
    Use-DevSetup -List
}
```

Shows using the function result to proceed with DevSetup operations.

## PARAMETERS

### CommonParameters
This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose, -WarningAction, and -WarningVariable. For more information, see [about_CommonParameters](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

## INPUTS

## OUTPUTS

### [System.Boolean]
### Returns $true if the DevSetup environment is successfully initialized.
### Returns $false if initialization fails at any step.
## NOTES
- This should be the first function called when setting up DevSetup
- Performs initialization in a specific sequence:
  1. Installs core dependencies via Install-CoreDependencies
  2. Creates the main .devsetup directory using Get-DevSetupPath
  3. Initializes the environments directory via Initialize-DevSetupEnvs
- Uses fail-fast approach - stops immediately if core dependencies cannot be installed
- Creates the .devsetup directory in the user's home directory if it doesn't exist
- Uses -Force flag for directory creation to handle any permission issues
- Suppresses directory creation output using Out-Null for clean console experience
- Provides verbose logging when .devsetup directory already exists
- Validates each initialization step and returns appropriate success/failure status
- Includes comprehensive try-catch error handling with descriptive error messages
- Color-coded console output for different phases: Cyan for progress, Green for success
